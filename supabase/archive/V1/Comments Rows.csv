13,27,1,"It was a little awkward to see with the light blue texture on white background, but there was a slight pattern of repeating dips on this light curve. I'll take a look and see if I can get some new sectors to add to this planet.",cebdc7a2-d8af-45b3-b37f-80f328ff54d6,,
14,25,1,Definitely looks like there's a planet here. Also worth noting that all the dips line up near-perfectly when the curve is phase-folded,cebdc7a2-d8af-45b3-b37f-80f328ff54d6,,

17,45,1,"Yep, if you look at the binned graph (on the left-hand side), you'll see there's a recurring pattern of dips. The phase-folded graph (on the right-hand side) shows all those dips folded onto each other. Since they all appear to line up, it's likely that there is a planet here :)",cebdc7a2-d8af-45b3-b37f-80f328ff54d6,,
