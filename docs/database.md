We've got a basic connection to our Postgresql database in `database/connection.py` and are adding a special connection to a Unity server in `database/unity-integration.py`

We've got plans to introduce a self-hosted instance of Moralis, but using Postgres rather than Mongo, as per [this post](https://forum.moralis.io/t/solved-self-hosting-with-postgresql/20881)
